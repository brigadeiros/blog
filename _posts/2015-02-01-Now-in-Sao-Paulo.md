Because of the draught, the water reserves of this city that uses 16.000.000 liters of water **per hour**, have gotten so low as to make water racioning very likely. This means one day with and the next day without water. Storing a greater quantity of water than we already do, resolves nothing in terms of learning to live with a lower water footprint.
