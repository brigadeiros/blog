Because of the draught, the water reserves of this city that uses **16.000.000 liters** of water **per hour**, have gotten so low as to make water racioning very likely. 

This means one day with and the next day without water. 

Storing a greater quantity of water than we already do, resolves nothing in terms of learning to live with a lower water footprint.
